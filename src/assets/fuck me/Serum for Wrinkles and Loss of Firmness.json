  "productIngredients": "Collagen is the main component of the dermis: it ensures its structure and resistance. Starting around age 20, the quantity of collagen in the dermis decreases by about 1% per year, making the skin less dense and leading to the appearance of fine lines on its surface.\nThe antioxidant benefit of vitamin C helps prevent the breakdown of collagen fibers while plant collagen stimulates the natural production of new fibers.\nHow to apply\nApply 3 to 4 drops morning and evening to clean, dry skin. Gently massage the face and neck with circular motions. Finish with a moisturizing cream adapted to your skin typology.\nDirections of use\nACTIVE INGREDIENTS\nPlant Collagen (1%):\nPlant fragments of type I collagen that help strengthen the skin's 3D network to prevent loss of firmness. By mimicking human collagen, this biotech active stimulates fibroblasts, which make collagen fibers, to help reduce the depth of wrinkles. Vegan. GMO-free.\nVitamin C (10%):\nThis molecule is known to brighten the complexion and slow down the photoaging of the skin. The antioxidant activity of the vitamin C allows to neutralize the free radicals. The skin is thus better protected from these external aggressions which degrade the collagen fibers and support the appearance of the wrinkles and fine lines. Moreover, by protecting fibroblasts from oxidation, vitamin C promotes the synthesis of new functional collagen fibers to preserve the skin's firmness.",
