  "productIngredients": "THE ACTIVES\nZinc PCA (4%):\nA trace element naturally present in the body, zinc is an essential part of many of the body's enzymatic mechanisms from the metabolism of food, supporting our natural defenses and the renewal of tissues.\nDerived from beetroot, zinc is ideal for oily skin and significantly reduces sebum (oil) secretion.Coupled with L-Pyrrolidone Carboxylic Acid, zinc promotes cell differentiation and strengthens the skin's barrier function to protect from future flare-ups.\nFinally, zinc is also known to limit the development of microorganisms that cause many skin imbalances.\nBamboo extract:\nBeing naturally porous, bamboo absorbs excess sebum to reduce shine and visible oiliness. We source our bamboo from Indian forests.\nDirections of use\nThis moisturizer is concentrated in zinc PCA, an antibacterial ingredient that reduces blemishes caused by excess sebum. In addition, the mattifying effects of the bamboo extract work to reduce excess skin shine.",
