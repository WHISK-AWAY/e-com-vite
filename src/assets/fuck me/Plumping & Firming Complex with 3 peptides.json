  "productIngredients": "Directions of use\nThis serum is suitable for all skin typologies. It's particularly recommended for mature skin that's experiencing sagging, a loss of density, and the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.\nCollagen and elastin are key proteins, naturally synthesized by the body, and which provide support for the skin. Their synthesis decreases over time making the skin less dense, sagging appearance and more vulnerable to external aggressions.\nThe 3 peptides present in this serum act simultaneously on different targets involved in the support and density of the skin. Acetyl tetrapeptide 9 acts on the lumican protein, to strengthen the structure of the skin. Acetyl tetrapeptide 11 acts on a protein present on the surface of the skin to smooth it. Cyclo tetrapeptide 24 is an antioxidant, and helps fight free radicals.\nACTIVE INGREDIENTS\nCyclopeptide 5: STRUCTURE\nCyclic, its structure helps it bind to receptors on the skin's surface to initiate cellular communication. It then improves the repair mechanisms of the skin. As a result, your skin is more elastic and the appearance of wrinkles is reduced.\nAcetyl tetrapeptide 9: SUPPORT\nComposed of 4 amino acids, this peptide helps organize fibers in the dermis to ensure more firmness and restore your facial contours. The skin is firmer and more plump.\nAcetyl tetrapeptide 11: DENSITY\nThis peptide promotes the multiplication of skin cells in order to increase cell density and accelerate skin regeneration. The skin is denser and fine lines are filled.",
