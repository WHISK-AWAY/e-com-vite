  "productIngredients": "THE ACTIVES\nAzelaic acid (10%):\nSebum plays an important part in maintaining a healthy hydrolipidic film barrier and keeping the skin hydrated. However, overproduction of sebum can cause skin to become oily and blotchy. It can also block pores, leading to the formation of spots, blackheads and acne. This serum is highly concentrated in azelaic acid to regulate sebum production for skin thatâ€™s more matte and less greasy.\nOrganic Bamboo Extract:\nBeing naturally porous, bamboo absorbs excess sebum to reduce shine and visible oiliness. We source our organic bamboo from Indian forests.\nZinc:\nEssential for healthy skin, this mineral is loved for its anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and mattifying properties. Zinc is used to combat many skin complaints including excess sebum production.\nHOW TO USE IT\nApply 3 to 4 drops to clean, dry skin each morning and evening.Gently massage into face and neck in circular motions. Follow with your usual moisturizer or night cream.\nFor optimal results, we recommend to use this serum consistently for at least four weeks.\n",
