  "productIngredients": "Dehydrated skin causes feelings of tightness and reveals more fine lines. In order to prevent the moisture from evaporating, your skin is covered with a hydrolipidic film barrier that's composed of sebum and sweat. Many factors can damage this protective hydrolipidic film, such as heat, dry air, pollution, overly aggressive cosmetics, etc. With a hyaluronic acid concentration of 1%, this toner helps retain long-lasting hydration in the skin.\nHyaluronic Acid (1%)\nDerived from wheat fermentation, this ingredient is known for its hydrating properties. It can retain up to a thousand times its weight in water.\nYour body's production of hyaluronic acid naturally decreases with age, which leads to the appearance of the first fine lines on the surface of your skin. The daily intake of hyaluronic acid makes it possible to compensate for this reduction, to reduce the appearance of fine lines, and to make the skin more supple and more toned.\nAloe Vera\nAloe vera gel is widely used in cosmetics because of its many beneficial properties for the skin, especially for hydration. It also works to soothe, and relieve irritation and itching. It's also recognized for its healing and regenerating properties.\nThe skin is naturally acidic. Certain cleansers with a higher pH or external factors like pollution can disturb its fragile balance. When damaged, the skin's acid mantle becomes more susceptible to irritation and bacteria.\nWith an acidic pH similar to that of the skin, this moisturizing toner has the ability to rebalance the skin pH after each time you cleanse your face, while eliminating the limestone and mineral traces present in your tap water. Concentrated in active ingredients to illuminate the complexion,  this toner works to rehydrate your skin and reduce the sensations of tightness experienced with dry skin.\nHow to use\nSoak a cotton pad with the hydrating toner.\nApply it evenly to your face each morning and evening while avoiding your eyes.\nFollow up with your daily serum and cream.\nParticles may form at the bottom of the bottle. This is a normal phenomenon linked to the high concentration of active ingredients in the product. Be sure to shake your hydrating toner well before use.\n",
