  "productIngredients": "Principal actives\nCeramides (1%):\nThese lipids are naturally present between the cells of the stratum corneum. Ceramides act as intercellular cement, reinforcing the cutaneous barrier and limiting dehydration. They help protect and nourish lips.\nHyaluronic acid:\nAble to retain up to 1000 times its weight in water, this macromolecule instantly hydrates lips and protects them from dehydration. It helps soften and smooth the look of fine lines.\nMango Butter:\nRich in essential fatty acids, this butter melts onto skin and forms a protective barrier that helps repair chapping and damage.\nThe Lip Mask has an enveloping balm-gel texture that helps repair and soothe chapped lips.\nHow to apply the Lip Mask\nThere are two ways to use the Lip Mask:\n1. Apply a generous layer to lips and leave on for 15 minutes. Remove excess with a cotton pad.\n2. Apply the repairing mask in a thick layer in the evening and leave on overnight.\nIf your lips are severely chapped or damaged, use nightly.\nOptimize the effectiveness of this mask, by first using our\nconcentrated in exfoliating actives to remove dead skin cells.\nUnlike other skin, our lips do not produce sebum and are therefore more vulnerable to external aggressors. Dead skin and chapping are the signs of lip dehydration.\nEnriched with ceramides and hyaluronic acid, the Lip Mask helps repair chapped, damaged lips thanks to two mechanisms: it forms a protective film that limits water evaporation and reinforces the skin barrier.\n",
