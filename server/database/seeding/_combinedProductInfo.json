Thanks to its high level of antioxidants, retinol can fight free radicals – which cause the skin to age prematurely. Free radicals accumulate on the skin's barrier due to factors like UV exposure and pollution. Highly anti-inflammatory, retinol is able to treat the inflammatory aspect of skin aging. It regulates the production of melanin too, a skin pigment that causes brown spots and hyperpigmentation. Retinol can also boost the production of hyaluronic acid – essential for hydration. Plus prevent the depletion of the skin’s collagen and elastin stores: ensuring skin stays supple, plump, and firm.\nSoy Oil:\nIdeal for mature skin, soy oil is known to activate cell renewal. Our soy oil is extracted from fresh soybeans and is guaranteed GMO-free.\nCastor Oil:\nNon-irritating and non-comedogenic, our castor oil comes from cold-pressed Ricinus communis seeds, which have been used in cosmetics for over 4000 years. Particularly beneficial for mature skin, castor oil is even rumored to have been used as a make-up remover by Cleopatra.","categories":["serums","face"],"images":[{"imageURL":"https://media.typology.com/storyblok/c5bcc37020/serum-au-retinol__main__8453740e58784eda927da5ec3268198a.jpg","image":"serum-au-retinol__main__8453740e58784eda927da5ec3268198a.jpg","imageDesc":"product-front"},{"imageURL":"https://media.typology.com/storyblok/473fc2e80e/serum-au-retinol__hover__f0d3ee84037048bd93b239451940a23d.jpg","image":"serum-au-retinol__hover__f0d3ee84037048bd93b239451940a23d.jpg","imageDesc":"product-texture"},{"imageURL":"https://media.typology.com/storyblok/1490x1570/b40f67120b/lab-1012_image-full_web1.jpg","image":"lab-1012_image-full_web1.jpg","imageDesc":"product-alt"},{"imageURL":"https://media.typology.com/storyblok/438c37477b/serum-au-retinol__additional__4867b56e21414eaebc8cfe1a1cd5ea1e.jpg","image":"serum-au-retinol__additional__4867b56e21414eaebc8cfe1a1cd5ea1e.jpg","imageDesc":"product-dimensions"},{"imageURL":"https://media.typology.com/storyblok/4088d48514/serum-au-retinol__additional__ecfde497002a41eb9e11d28cb83ae112.jpg","image":"serum-au-retinol__additional__ecfde497002a41eb9e11d28cb83ae112.jpg","imageDesc":"product-back"}]},{"productName":"10-Ingredient Body Cream","productShortDesc":"This minimalist, lightweight formula hydrates all skin typologies, including sensitive, without leaving a greasy residue.

It also has an action on the production of melanin in the skin, allowing to reduce the appearance of brown spots that can appear with age.\nDamask Rose Extract:\nConsidered an ancient variety of rose, Damask Rose is native to the Orient. Allied to mature skins by its regenerating action and its antioxidant properties, it helps to limit the premature ageing of cells and brings brightness and luminosity to the complexion. Its calming action reduces the irritating effect of retinol.","categories":["toners","face"],"images":[{"imageURL":"https://media.typology.com/storyblok/1600x1600/beefdf879a/tone-1006_page-produit.jpg","image":"tone-1006_page-produit.jpg","imageDesc":"product-front"},{"imageURL":"https://media.typology.com/storyblok/1600x1600/c3092546fe/better_aging_carousel-produit_tonic.jpg","image":"better_aging_carousel-produit_tonic.jpg","imageDesc":"product-close"},{"imageURL":"https://media.typology.com/storyblok/1600x1600/31c8e709a2/better_aging_carousel-produit_dos.jpg","image":"better_aging_carousel-produit_dos.jpg","imageDesc":"product-back"},{"imageURL":"https://media.typology.com/storyblok/1600x1600/1f9121777e/better_aging_carousel-ingredient.jpg","image":"better_aging_carousel-ingredient.jpg","imageDesc":"product-alt"},{"imageURL":"https://media.typology.com/video-storyblok/x/fdc8074c02/18_toniques.mp4","image":"18_toniques.mp4","imageDesc":"video-usage"},{"imageURL":"https://media.typology.com/video-storyblok/1200x1500/8f3e90e51d/better_aging_hover-bottle.gif","image":"better_aging_hover-bottle.gif","imageDesc":"gif-product"}]},{"productName":"Gentle Resurfacing Serum with 10% Lactic Acid + Acerola Extract","productShortDesc":"Highly concentrated in lactic acid, this serum gently exfoliates skin for a more even, radiant complexion. 97% naturally derived.

It can hold upto a thousand times its weight in water, making it a powerful skincare ingredient for instant hydration. As we age, our bodies produce significantly less hyaluronic acid, causing our skin to dehydrate and develop fine lines. There are two types of hyaluronic acid. The first has a high molecular weight, meaning it remains on the surface of the epidermis, creating a protective film to keep water in the skin cells. The second has low molecular weight and has a much smaller molecular size so that it can penetrate much deeper into the skin and stimulate the body's natural production of hyaluronic acid. Combined these two types of hyaluronic acid offer the skin instant and effective hydration that retains its moisture throughout the day. With daily use hyaluronic acid restores moisture to the skin, reduces the appearance of fine lines and creates a complexion that’s noticeably more supple, plump and toned.\nPro Vitamin B5 (2%):\nAlso called Panthenol, pro-vitamin B5 stimulates the regeneration of dermal and epidermal cells, helping the skin retain more moisture and maintain its softness.\nBio-sourced Aquaxyl:\nDerived from sugar, this molecule increases the natural production of hyaluronic acid in the skin's keratinocytes and fibroblasts.

These benefits make it ideal for oily skin, acne-prone skin, skin with imperfections, and smooth fine lines and wrinkles.Salicylic acid is also known to limit the development of harmful microorganisms, making it an effective ingredient for cleaning and purifying the surface layers of the skin. It also helps prevent the appearance of blackheads and the clogging of pores. A molecule extracted from plants, salicylic acid was first extracted from willow bark in 1829 by a French pharmacist named Pierre-Joseph Leroux. Salicylic acid is naturally present in several plants, particularly meadowsweet and willow, from which it takes its name. The aspirin medication we know today is actually a synthetic derivative of salicylic acid (acetyl-salicylic acid). It was first manufactured in 1853 by the chemist C.F. Gerhardt.\nCentifolia Rose Hydrolate:\nAlso called the rose with a hundred leaves, this fragrant flower's floral water is known for its soothing properties, especially on surface irritations.

A trace element naturally present in the body, zinc is essential and is involved in many of the body's enzymatic mechanisms.

It also helps the skin receive more oxygen, leaving it visibly more toned, radiant and soft while reducing the appearance of pores. Lack of sleep, stress and smoking are known to trigger harmful free radicals, which oxidise the skin cells and create a dull complexion. The high concentration of vitamin C in this serum effectively combats this process.\nAlbizia Julibrissin Extract:\nAlso known as the silk tree, this native Asian plant boasts delicate fan-shaped pink flowers. Its extract contains properties known for restoring radiance to the skin. Albizia Julibrissin extract also brings vitality back to fatigued-looking skin caused by glycation and glycoxidation. Glycation is a natural chemical reaction of sugar molecules attaching themselves to the proteins of the dermis. These proteins are then more sensitive to oxidation (glycoxidation) which results in more free radicals, and more fine lines around the eyes.

With a concentration of over 2%, the vitamin C contained in this toner offers antioxidants that work to fight against skin photoaging, restoring the complexion and all its radiance. Naturally present in the skin, vitamin C helps neutralize free radicals generated by exposure to the sun, pollution or even smoking. The skin is thus better protected from these external aggressions, responsible for photoaging. It is a molecule known to brighten the complexion, reduce pigment spots, and help slow down photoaging of the skin.

Vegan. Made in France.","productIngredients":"Salicylic Acid (2%):\nSalicylic acid is a beta-hydroxy acid (BHA). Its keratolytic (peeling) and exfoliating effects help promote desquamation – the elimination of dead skin. This makes it ideal for oily skin, acne-prone skin, skin with imperfections, as well as smooth fine lines and wrinkles.Salicylic acid is also known to limit the development of harmful microorganisms, making it an effective ingredient for cleaning and purifying the surface layers of the skin. It also helps prevent the appearance of blackheads and the clogging of pores. A molecule extracted from plants, salicylic acid was first extracted from willow bark in 1829 by a French pharmacist named Pierre-Joseph Leroux. Salicylic acid is naturally present in several plants, particularly meadowsweet and willow, from which it takes its name.The common aspirin pill is actually a synthetic derivative of salicylic acid (acetyl-salicylic acid). It was first manufactured in 1853 by the chemist C.F. Gerhardt.\nZinc (1%):\nDerived from beetroot, zinc is ideal for oily skin and significantly reduces sebum (oil) secretion.Coupled with L-Pyrrolidone Carboxylic Acid, zinc promotes cell differentiation and strengthens the skin's barrier function to protect from future flare-ups. A trace element naturally present in the body, zinc is an essential part of many of the body's enzymatic mechanisms from the metabolism of food, supporting our natural defenses and the renewal of tissues. Finally, zinc is also known to limit the development of microorganisms that cause many skin imbalances.","categories":["face","acne","serums","exfoliators"],"images":[{"imageURL":"https://media.typology.com/storyblok/ed1914b9d5/serum-a-l-acide-salicylique__main__3f87136eb78c4fea96c4fd41a0300994.jpg","image":"serum-a-l-acide-salicylique__main__3f87136eb78c4fea96c4fd41a0300994.jpg","imageDesc":"product-front"},{"imageURL":"https://media.typology.com/storyblok/1600x1600/097ae55b2f/03_acide_salicylique_pipette_texture.jpg","image":"03_acide_salicylique_pipette_texture.jpg","imageDesc":"product-close"},{"imageURL":"https://media.typology.com/storyblok/1280x1280/1678d89dc8/05_dos_salicylique.jpg","image":"05_dos_salicylique.jpg","imageDesc":"product-back"},{"imageURL":"https://media.typology.com/storyblok/2e0739c214/serum-a-l-acide-salicylique__carousel_images__c624528d3aaa49b0a6de5bf34f44d4df.png","image":"serum-a-l-acide-salicylique__carousel_images__c624528d3aaa49b0a6de5bf34f44d4df.png","imageDesc":"product-alt"},{"imageURL":"https://media.typology.com/storyblok/6f2673a00b/serum-a-l-acide-salicylique__carousel_images__414bcffdb32c41128c37752324c5a16e.png","image":"serum-a-l-acide-salicylique__carousel_images__414bcffdb32c41128c37752324c5a16e.png","imageDesc":"product-alt"},{"imageURL":"https://media.typology.com/storyblok/e9e6d70495/serum-a-l-acide-salicylique__carousel_images__2a0acbaa741f494bbbc8d3948a81b376.png","image":"serum-a-l-acide-salicylique__carousel_images__2a0acbaa741f494bbbc8d3948a81b376.png","imageDesc":"product-alt"},{"imageURL":"https://media.typology.com/video-storyblok/x/5e170a3a14/02_serum-imperfections.mp4","image":"02_serum-imperfections.mp4","imageDesc":"video-usage"},{"imageURL":"https://media.typology.com/video-storyblok/8851c40dd5/serum-a-l-acide-salicylique__hover__08ec450c51be4fd69892940363e7894a.mp4","image":"serum-a-l-acide-salicylique__hover__08ec450c51be4fd69892940363e7894a.mp4","imageDesc":"video-product"}]},{"productName":"Tinted Concealer","productShortDesc":"This medium-high coverage tinted concealer is enriched with caffeine, niacinamide, and cornflower hydrolate to reduce the appearance of dark circles and puffiness, instantly and long term.
