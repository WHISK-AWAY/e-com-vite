Your body's production of hyaluronic acid naturally decreases with age, which leads to the appearance of the first fine lines on the surface of your skin. The daily intake of hyaluronic acid makes it possible to compensate for this reduction, to reduce the appearance of fine lines, and to make the skin more supple and more toned.\nAloe Vera:\nAloe vera gel is widely used in cosmetics because of its many beneficial properties for the skin, especially for hydration. It also works to soothe, and relieve irritation and itching. It's also recognized for its healing and regenerating properties.",
