It compensates for water loss from the skin while providing it with the essential vitamins and trace elements necessary for its repair.\nHyaluronic acid:\nFrom fermented wheat, hyaluronic acid is known for its highly moisturizing properties. This molecule can in fact retain up to a thousand times its weight in water. The low molecular weight hyaluronic acid present in this cream deeply moisturizes the epidermis and gives the skin a more smooth and plump appearance.\nKaranja oil:\nDue to its high content of flavonoids, karanja oil is known for its antioxidant properties. It helps protect from the sun by preventing the skinâ€™s photoaging.",
