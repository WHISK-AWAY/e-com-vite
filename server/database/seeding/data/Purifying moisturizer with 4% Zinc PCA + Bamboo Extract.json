Derived from beetroot, zinc is ideal for oily skin and significantly reduces sebum (oil) secretion.Coupled with L-Pyrrolidone Carboxylic Acid, zinc promotes cell differentiation and strengthens the skin's barrier function to protect from future flare-ups. Finally, zinc is also known to limit the development of microorganisms that cause many skin imbalances.\nBamboo extract:\nBeing naturally porous, bamboo absorbs excess sebum to reduce shine and visible oiliness. We source our bamboo from Indian forests.",
