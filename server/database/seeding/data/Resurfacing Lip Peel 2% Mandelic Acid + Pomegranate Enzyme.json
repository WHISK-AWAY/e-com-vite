By breaking the bonds between cells, this active ingredient helps eliminate the layer of dead cells on the surface of the lips. Lips are then softer and more supple.\nPomegranate Enzyme:\nThese fruit enzymes stimulate skin's natural hydration while providing micro-exfoliation that complements mandelic acid.\nTrehalose:\nThis is a dissacharide that limits water loss from lips. It is found in nature where it helps prevent the dehydration of many plants and micro-organisms in extreme winter conditions.",
