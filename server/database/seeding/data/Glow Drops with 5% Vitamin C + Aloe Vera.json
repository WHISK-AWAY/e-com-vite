Extracted from corn, our natural vitamin C is stable to light and heat, and is developed to penetrate the skin. This molecule helps keep skin luminous by trapping free radicals generated by sun exposure, pollution, or smoking. The skin is then better protected from external aggressors.\nAloe vera:\nRich in minerals, vitamins, and amino acids, aloe vera pulp is known for its hydrating and soothing properties. Its capacity of water retention makes it possible to fight against dehydration and soften the skin.",
