  "productName": "Gentle Resurfacing Serum with 10% Lactic Acid + Acerola Extract",
  "productShortDesc": "Highly concentrated in lactic acid, this serum gently exfoliates skin for a more even, radiant complexion. 97% naturally derived. Vegan. Made in France.",
  "productIngredients": "Lactic acid 10%:\nLactic acid is known for its exfoliating effect on the superficial layers of the skin. This AHA helps eliminate dead skin cells from the epidermis to make facial skin smoother, brighter and more uniform. This molecule, which is larger than the glycolic acid molecule, will penetrate less coldly into the epidermis and will therefore be less irritating than the latter. Lactic acid is therefore a good alternative to skin that has not tolerated glycolic acid products.\nAcerola extract:\nAcerola extract is known for its antioxidant virtues, which help combat the free radicals responsible for dull complexion.",
