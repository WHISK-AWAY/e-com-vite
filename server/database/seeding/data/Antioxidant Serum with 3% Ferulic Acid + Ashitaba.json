Ferulic acid also improves skin texture by stimulating the production of collagen and elastin, resulting in brighter, firmer, and smoother skin. These two effects help delay the appearance of first wrinkles.\nAshitaba extract:\nA symbol of longevity in Japan, Ashitaba is a plant rich in flavonoids, antioxidant compounds that protect the skin from free radicals.
