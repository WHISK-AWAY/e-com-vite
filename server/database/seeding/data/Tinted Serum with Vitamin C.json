  "productIngredients": "Vitamin C:\nPresent in many plants, vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant known to brighten the complexion, reduce pigmentation spots and slow down the skin's photoaging process. Sourced from corn, our vitamin C extraction process ensures it remains stable in both light and heat, plus it is specially developed to deeply penetrate the skin.This active ingredient helps keep skin luminous by trapping and protecting from free radicals that accumulate from excess sun exposure, pollution and smoking. By preventing the synthesis of melanin, vitamin C also limits the formation of brown spots, making skin look more even.\nSqualane:\nDerived from olives, squalane has a structure that's very similar to the skin which helps it easily and deeply penetrate and deliver nourishment. Non-greasy, each application softens the skin, fights dryness and helps repair the protective hydrolipidic film barrier. Squalane can also retain hydration and reduce the tight, itchy feeling typically caused by dry skin.\nAloe vera:\nRich in minerals, vitamins and amino acids, the fresh pulp from the leaves of the aloe vera plant is known to moisturise and soothe skin. Its capacity to retain water helps to fight dehydration and soften the skin too.",
