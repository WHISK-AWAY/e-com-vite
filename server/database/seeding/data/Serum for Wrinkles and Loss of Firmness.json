  "productIngredients": "Plant Collagen (1%):\nPlant fragments of type I collagen that help strengthen the skin's 3D network to prevent loss of firmness. By mimicking human collagen, this biotech active stimulates fibroblasts, which make collagen fibers, to help reduce the depth of wrinkles. Vegan. GMO-free.\nVitamin C (10%):\nThis molecule is known to brighten the complexion and slow down the photoaging of the skin. The antioxidant activity of the vitamin C allows to neutralize the free radicals. The skin is thus better protected from these external aggressions which degrade the collagen fibers and support the appearance of the wrinkles and fine lines. Moreover, by protecting fibroblasts from oxidation, vitamin C promotes the synthesis of new functional collagen fibers to preserve the skin's firmness.",
